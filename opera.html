<h2>The Grand Duke</h2>
    <h3>Act I</h3>
    <p>[Exeunt Chorus. Manent LUDWIG, LISA, ERNEST, JULIA, and NOTARY.]</p>

    <p>JULIA. Well, a nice mess you've got us into! There's an
    end of our precious plot! All up—pop—fizzle—bang—done for!</p>

    <p>LUD. Yes, but—ha! ha!—fancy my choosing the Grand Duke's
    private detective, of all men, to make a confidant of! When you
    come to think of it, it's really devilish funny!</p>

    <p>ERN. (angrily). When you come to think of it, it's
    extremely injudicious to admit into a conspiracy every
    pudding-headed baboon who presents himself!</p>

    <p>LUD. Yes—I should never do that. If I were chairman of
    this gang, I should hesitate to enrol any baboon who couldn't
    produce satisfactory credentials from his last Zoological
    Gardens.</p>

    <p>LISA. Ludwig is far from being a baboon. Poor boy, he
    could not help giving us away—it's his trusting nature—he was
    deceived.</p>

    <p>JULIA. (furiously). His trusting nature! (To LUDWIG.) Oh,
    I should like to talk to you in my own language for five
    minutes—only five minutes! I know some good, strong, energetic
    English remarks that would shrivel your trusting nature into
    raisins—only you wouldn't understand them!</p>

    <p>LUD. Here we perceive one of the disadvantages of a
    neglected education!</p>
