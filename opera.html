    <h2>The Grand Duke</h2>
    <h3>Act I</h3>

    <p>[Exeunt Chorus. Manent LUDWIG, LISA, ERNEST, JULIA, and NOTARY.]</p>

    <h4>JUL</h4>
    <p>RECITATIVE:  Well, a nice mess you've got us into! There's an end of our precious plot! All up—pop—fizzle—bang—done for!</p>

    <h4>LUD</h4>
    <p>RECITATIVE:  Yes, but—ha! ha!—fancy my choosing the Grand Duke's private detective, of all men, to make a confidant of! When you come to think of it, it's really devilish funny!</p>

    <h4>ERN</h4>
    <p>(angrily)</p>
    <p>RECITATIVE:  When you come to think of it, it's extremely injudicious to admit into a conspiracy every pudding-headed baboon who presents himself!</p>

    <h4>LUD</h4>
    <p>RECITATIVE:  Yes—I should never do that. If I were chairman of this gang, I should hesitate to enrol any baboon who couldn't produce satisfactory credentials from his last Zoological Gardens.</p>

    <h4>LIS</h4>
    <p>RECITATIVE: Ludwig is far from being a baboon. Poor boy, he could not help giving us away—it's his trusting nature—he was deceived.</p>

    <h4>JUL</h4>
    <p>(furiously)</p>
    <p>RECITATIVE: His trusting nature! (To LUDWIG.) Oh, I should like to talk to you in my own language for five minutes—only five minutes! I know some good, strong, energetic English remarks that would shrivel your trusting nature into raisins—only you wouldn't understand them!</p>

    <h4>LUD</h4>
    <p>RECITATIVE:  Here we perceive one of the disadvantages of a neglected education!</p>
